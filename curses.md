Okay so we have this teacher called \[redacted cause I respect his privacy\] and he gave us some homework about finishing a .NET Framework (Windows Forms) application until 12.00AM+03.00.

My computer runs on Linux and cannot handle Visual Studio. And hes going to give our marks from this project. What do I do.
Respond asap, ly
