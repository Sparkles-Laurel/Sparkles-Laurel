### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on *[Pisi the Package Manager](https://github.com/SparkySimp/pisi).* <!--(See [CattyLang/CattyLang](https://github.com/CattyLang/CattyLang))-->
- 🌱 I’m currently learning *x86 Assembly*.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on *language standard libraries*.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with *Assembly Language*.
- 💬 Ask me about *anything appropriate!* I'm open to anything.
- 📫 How to reach me: Twitter/Reddit DMs always open. (clarify that you've found me from GitHub though). Also see [this](https://github.com/SparkySimp/SparkySimp/discussions/1)
- ⚡ Fun fact: That little PRO indicates that I have GitHub PRO. It's [free for students](https://education.github.com)!
- sad about the fact that I can't register again for GitHub PRO. ~~maybe I can try my certificate of appreciation~~.

- apparently im trans 🏳️‍⚧️
- Bilişim bölümü öğrencileri için kurduğumuz [depoya](https://github.com/SparkySimp/ntp-cozumler) bir göz atmanızı şiddetle tavsiye ediyorum.
