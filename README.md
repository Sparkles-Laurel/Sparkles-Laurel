## I am so tired that I can't come up with a title.
Hi, my name is Kıvılcım (or Sparkles if you prefer), and I am a really shy 12th grade IT student from Turkey. I have been programming since I was 6 and I have a special interest in systems programming. I currently maintain [lament](https://github.com/sparkles-laurel/lament).

I know most of my works are stubs cause I had some serious data loss incidents when I was 12, the computer that included my actually functional programs died due to battery leaks and my parents didn't let me recover my stuff from the SSD. (they are busy with hiding the SATA to USB controllers from me.)

I'm extremely sensitive to criticism due to a bunch of neurological disorders, it's probably not your fault if I have a breakdown while talking to you but please be patient.

I apologise for the shit profile, yet I hope you enjoy reading my half-finished programs (contributions are also welcome).
(one last sincere request please avoid using they/them pronouns for me they immediately make me collapse)
